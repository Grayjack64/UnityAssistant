# System: User Interface (UI) System
## Purpose
*Provides all the visual interfaces for player interaction, displaying game information and allowing players to control the game.*
## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**:  Player Input System (UI navigation and selection), all other game systems (for data display).
- **Output Provided**:  Player actions to other game systems (e.g., ship upgrades, weapon firing, crew assignments).
- **Events Triggered**:  `UIElementClicked`, `UIElementHovered`, `UIValueChanged`.
## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["elementID", "elementType", "elementPosition", "elementSize"],
  "optionalFields": ["elementText", "elementImage", "elementTooltip"],
  "validationRules": ["elementType in ['Button', 'Text', 'Image', 'Slider']"]
}
```
## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: Constantly, for displaying game information and responding to player input.
- **Common patterns**: Use a UI framework like Unity's UI system or a third-party solution. Implement data binding to automatically update UI elements with game data. Use event handlers to respond to player input on UI elements.  Consider implementing a modular UI system to allow reuse and extensions.
- **Anti-patterns**: Hardcoding UI layouts and element properties. Creating cluttered or confusing UI designs. Failing to provide clear feedback to player actions. Blocking the main thread with expensive UI operations.
- **Test scenarios**: Testing all UI elements for functionality and responsiveness. Verifying that UI elements display correct data. Testing UI navigation and keyboard shortcuts. Testing the UI on different screen resolutions and aspect ratios.
