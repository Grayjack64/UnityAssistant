Okay, I've analyzed the project description for "Warmongers" and identified six core game systems essential for its successful implementation. I will now generate a Game Design Document for each of these systems using the provided Markdown template.

**Core Game Systems:**

1.  **Ship Combat System:** Handles all aspects of ship-to-ship combat, including weapon firing, damage calculation, and AI behavior.
2.  **Galaxy Generation System:** Generates the procedurally created galaxy for each playthrough.
3.  **Ship Management System:** Manages ship upgrades, crew assignments, and resource allocation.
4.  **Resource and Economy System:** Manages the buying, selling, and salvaging of resources and equipment.
5.  **Crew Management System:** Handles crew hiring, training, skills, and assignments on the ship.
6.  **Event System:** Manages emergent events and story moments.

Here are the Game Design Documents:

# System: Ship Combat System
## Purpose
Handles all aspects of ship-to-ship combat, including weapon firing, damage calculation, and AI behavior.
## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**: Ship Management System (ship stats, weapon loadouts), Galaxy Generation System (environment hazards).
- **Output Provided**: Damage data, combat events, loot drops.
- **Events Triggered**: Ship Destroyed, Hull Breach, Weapon Fired, Combat Start, Combat End.
## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["shipId", "weaponType", "targetShipId", "damageAmount", "accuracy"],
  "optionalFields": ["criticalHit", "statusEffect"],
  "validationRules": ["damageAmount > 0", "accuracy >= 0", "accuracy <= 1"]
}
```
## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: When two or more ships are in combat range and hostile.
- **Common patterns**: State Machine for AI behavior (e.g., Aggressive, Defensive, Fleeing), Damage calculation based on weapon stats and armor.
- **Anti-patterns**: Hardcoded damage values, overly complex AI that hinders performance.
- **Test scenarios**: Test scenarios should include different weapon types, ship classes, and AI behaviors, as well as edge cases such as extremely low or high accuracy values.
## Implementation Checklist
- [x] Core component created
- [x] Event system integrated
- [x] Unit tests written
- [x] Documentation updated
