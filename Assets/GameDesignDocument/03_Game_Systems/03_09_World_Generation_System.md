# System: World Generation System
## Purpose
*Generates the galaxy map and its contents, including sectors, planets, stations, and resources, ensuring procedural content.*
## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**: Game State System (for run seed), Story System (for story event locations).
- **Output Provided**: Galaxy map data to Navigation System, resource locations to Resource Management System, encounter locations to Combat System and Story System.
- **Events Triggered**: `SectorDiscovered`, `PlanetDiscovered`, `StationDiscovered`.
## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["sectorX", "sectorY", "sectorType", "threatLevel"],
  "optionalFields": ["planetCount", "stationCount", "resourceNodes"],
  "validationRules": ["threatLevel >= 0", "sectorType in ['Nebula', 'Asteroid Field', 'Empty Space']"]
}
```
## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: At the start of a new game run. Potentially, on transition to a new sector to fill in the contents on arrival.
- **Common patterns**: Use a seeded random number generator to ensure consistent world generation for the same run seed. Implement a grid-based or graph-based representation of the galaxy map. Use biome distributions to determine sector types. Populate sectors with planets, stations, and resources based on sector type and threat level.
- **Anti-patterns**: Generating empty or uninteresting sectors. Creating unfair or unbalanced galaxy layouts. Failing to account for story event locations when generating the world. Generating sectors without resources.
- **Test scenarios**: Generating multiple galaxy maps with different seeds and verifying their content. Testing the distribution of sector types and resources. Verifying the placement of story event locations. Making sure sectors are of sufficient variety.
