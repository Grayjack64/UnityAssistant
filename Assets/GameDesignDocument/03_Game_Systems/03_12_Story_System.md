# System: Story System
## Purpose
*Manages the game's narrative, presenting story events, character interactions, and quests to the player.*
## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**: World Generation System (for event locations), Combat System (for combat encounters triggered by story events), Player Input System (for dialogue choices).
- **Output Provided**: UI System (for displaying story text and dialogue), Combat System (for triggering specific combat encounters), Game State System (for changing the game world based on player choices).
- **Events Triggered**: `StoryEventTriggered`, `DialogueStarted`, `DialogueEnded`, `QuestCompleted`.
## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["eventID", "eventType", "eventLocation", "eventText"],
  "optionalFields": ["dialogueOptions", "questRewards", "combatEncounter"],
  "validationRules": ["eventType in ['Dialogue', 'Combat', 'Puzzle']"]
}
```
## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: When the player enters a sector with a story event, completes a quest, or interacts with a character.
- **Common patterns**: Use a branching narrative structure to represent story events and dialogue choices. Trigger combat encounters based on story events. Provide the player with meaningful choices that affect the game world.
- **Anti-patterns**: Writing generic or uninteresting story events. Failing to integrate the story with the gameplay. Railroading the player into specific choices.
- **Test scenarios**: Playing through different story branches and verifying the outcomes. Testing combat encounters triggered by story events. Verifying that player choices have meaningful consequences.
