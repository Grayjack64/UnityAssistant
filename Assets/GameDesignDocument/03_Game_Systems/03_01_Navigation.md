# System: Navigation
## Purpose
This system manages the player's movement between beacons and sectors on the galaxy map.

## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**: Player input (beacon selection), Fuel System (fuel consumption), Rebel Fleet System (fleet position), Galaxy Generation System (sector and beacon data)
- **Output Provided**: Player location, Trigger for random encounters, Distance to Rebel Fleet
- **Events Triggered**: `onBeaconReached`, `onSectorEntered`, `onFuelDepleted`

## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["currentSector", "currentBeacon", "fuelConsumed"],
  "optionalFields": [],
  "validationRules": ["fuelConsumed >= 0"]
}
```

## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: When the player selects a beacon to travel to.
- **Common patterns**: Use graph traversal algorithms for pathfinding between beacons.
- **Anti-patterns**: Avoid allowing travel to unreachable beacons without sufficient fuel.
- **Test scenarios**:  Traveling to a valid beacon, attempting to travel without fuel, reaching a sector exit.
