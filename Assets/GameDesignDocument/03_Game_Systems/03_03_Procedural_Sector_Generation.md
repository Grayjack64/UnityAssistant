# System: Procedural Sector Generation
## Purpose
This system generates randomized sectors for the player to explore, including layout, events, and encounters.

## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**: Game State (current sector), Player Progression (unlocked content).
- **Output Provided**: Sector data (map layout, event locations, enemy types).
- **Events Triggered**: SectorGenerated, SectorEntered.

## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["sectorLayout", "eventLocations", "enemyTypes"],
  "optionalFields": ["specialEvents"],
  "validationRules": ["sectorLayout.length > 0"]
}
```

## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: At the start of a new run, upon entering a new sector.
- **Common patterns**: Use seeded random generation for replayability. Balance risk and reward based on sector difficulty.
- **Anti-patterns**: Generating impossible or overly easy sectors.
- **Test scenarios**: Generate multiple sectors with different seeds, test event distribution.
