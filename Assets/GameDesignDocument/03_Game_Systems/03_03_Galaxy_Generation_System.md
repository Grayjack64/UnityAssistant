# System: Galaxy Generation System
## Purpose
*This system procedurally generates the galaxy map, including sectors, planets, stations, and other points of interest.*
## Integration Points
- **Input Dependencies**:  Seed value (for deterministic generation), Game State System (for difficulty scaling).
- **Output Provided**:  Galaxy map data, sector layouts, resource distribution.
- **Events Triggered**: `GalaxyGenerated`, `SectorEntered`.
## Data Schema
```json
{
  "requiredFields": ["seed", "galaxySize", "sectorDensity"],
  "optionalFields": ["planetTypes", "stationTypes", "anomalyTypes"],
  "validationRules": ["galaxySize > 0", "sectorDensity >= 0"]
}
```
## AI Implementation Guide
- **When to use**: Called at the start of a new game or when the player jumps to a new sector.
- **Common patterns**:  Noise functions (e.g., Perlin noise) for generating terrain and resource distributions.  Weighted random selection for determining the types of planets and stations in a sector.  Graph data structure for representing the galaxy map and sector connections.
- **Anti-patterns**:  Generating the entire galaxy at once (leads to performance issues).  Creating sectors that are too similar.  Failing to account for resource scarcity.
- **Test scenarios**:
    - Generating a galaxy with different seed values and verifying the results are consistent.
    - Testing different galaxy sizes and sector densities to optimize performance.
    - Ensuring that resources are distributed logically across the galaxy.
    - Verifying that sector connections are valid.
