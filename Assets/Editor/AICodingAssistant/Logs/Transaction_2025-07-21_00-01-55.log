########## USER PROMPT ##########
Create needed .cs and scriptable objects for the system that will allow the following = The ship will be assembled from several modules - 
	Wings, 
	Weapon,
	Device,
	Engine,
	Body, 
	Bow,
	Ammo. All modules will have 3 types of sizes
 - Frigate ,
	Cruiser, 
	Battleship . 
Each module size can be connected with corresponding size only. Each module will have a specific hard point where it will be connected with other modules. Each module will have specific hardpoints for items installations, separate from the hard points for connecting to other modules. .   Example - Player starts with a body, that have 2 wings hard point and one tail hardpoint. Each modules can be equipped with items. Each module can provide any of the core stats for the ship:
 Hull, repair speed, max Power , PowerRechargeSpeed, CPU, Speed, Turn Speed, Shields, Accuracy, Damage, Money, Ship Name.

########## AGENTIC PROMPT SENT TO AI ##########
You are an expert Unity development agent. Your task is to analyze a user's request and create a step-by-step plan to fulfill it using a predefined set of tools.
Your response MUST be a single, raw JSON object that strictly adheres to the provided `ActionPlan` schema. Do not include any conversational text or Markdown fences. Your entire response must be only the JSON object.
Here is an example of the required JSON format, using the keys 'plan', 'tool', 'arguments', and 'description':
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "tool": "CreateCSharpScript",
      "arguments": {
        "filePath": "Assets/Scripts/MyScript.cs",
        "content": "public class MyScript { }"
      },
      "description": "Create the main script.",
    }
  ]
}
```
