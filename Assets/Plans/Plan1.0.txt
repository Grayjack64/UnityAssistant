The Improvement Plan: A Self-Correction Cycle
Your idea to feed the log file back to the AI is brilliant. It's a classic AI technique known as a correction loop. We can teach the AI to analyze its own failures and correct them.

Here is the updated code for AIOrchestrator.cs that implements this new, more intelligent workflow.

Updated AIOrchestrator.cs with Self-Correction
This new version includes the following changes:

Fixed ExecutePlan Method: I've added the missing case "CreateScriptableObjectAsset": to the switch statement, which will resolve the "Unknown tool" error.

New ProcessWithSelfCorrection Method: This method will now be the main entry point. It will:

Run the initial process as before.

Check for compiler errors.

If errors are found, it will automatically create a new prompt that includes the original request and the failed log file, asking the AI to generate a corrected plan.

Improved Prompts: I've reinforced the JSON format requirements in the documentation prompt to prevent the AI from using the wrong format.
